MESSAGEix Community Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Community Meeting aims to bring together researchers working on integrated 
assessment and/or energy system modeling using open source software. 

It is a platform for showcasing new developments and features of the MESSAGEix 
modeling framework, sharing knowledge on various modeling approaches and 
applications of the framework, and discussing best practices in model-based 
policy analysis. The meeting is a place for facilitating collaboration between 
MESSAGEix users from around the world, by creating a forum where users can 
share their latest research outcomes and modeling experiences.

The Community Meeting also aims to inspire new users of the MESSAGEix framework 
on the range of available possibilities and link them with other users in order 
to help them advance their modeling work.  
For information about the modeling framework, its structure, mathematical
formulation, installation, and much more, please see the `documentation <https://docs.messageix.org>`_.
