MESSAGEix Community Meeting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Community Meeting aims to bring together researchers working on integrated assessment and/or energy system modeling using open source software. 

It is a platform for showcasing new developments and features of the MESSAGEix modeling framework, sharing knowledge on various modeling approaches and applications of the framework, and discussing best practices in model-based policy analysis. The meeting is a place for facilitating collaboration between MESSAGEix users from around the world, by creating a forum where users can share their latest research outcomes and modeling experiences.

The Community Meeting also aims to inspire new users of the MESSAGEix framework on the range of available possibilities and link them with other users in order to help them advance their modeling work.  
For information about the model, its structure, mathematical
formulation and much more, please see the `documentation <https://docs.messageix.org>`_.

Needed requirements
"""""""""""""""""""

Each workshop is designed to be accessible for users with different
backgrounds and levels of experience with the modelling. However, there
are some pre-requisite knowledge and skills which you should
go through before getting started, including:

* Elementary computer programming (preferably in the Python or R language);
* Fundamental concepts of mathematical modelling, optimization,
  and data analysis; and
* Energy systems (e.g., energy supply, energy conversion
  technologies, and demand sectors and their linkages).

For a complete list, plus links to learning resources, see
`“Pre-requisite knowledge & skills" repo <https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/prereqs.html>`_
in the documentation.

Installation of MESSAGEix
""""""""""""""""""""""

Installing MESSAGEix before you're getting started with the workshop is highly
recommended. Complete instructions are provided in the documentation on the
`“Installation” <https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/install.html>`_
page of the documentation.

To successfully work through this workshop, we emphasize a few points
from the instructions:

* If you are not already familiar with the other installation methods,
  you should use Anaconda to install the framework.

* Under the `“Tutorials” <https://docs.messageix.org/en/stable/tutorials.html>`_
  page, you can download some simple models developed using MESSAGEix. To run these
  sample models, you need to install the Jupyter notebook software from Anaconda
  Navigator.

You can check our GitHub pages, where common issues and solutions are discussed:
