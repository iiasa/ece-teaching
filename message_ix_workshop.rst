MESSAGEix Workshop
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The aim of the workshop is to help new users of the MESSAGEix
modelling framework to get started with their modeling work.
The main features of the “framework” are introduced, and the
use cases of some features are shown. The user can learn how
to build an energy model and how to represent some policy constraints
in their energy scenarios.
For information about the model, its structure, mathematical
formulation and much more, please see the documentation
at: https://docs.messageix.org.
The different lectures contain the workshop slides, videos as
well as tutorials for hands-on examples.
