Course Objectives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In this course, students will gain a theoretical and applied perspective on the role of modelling in energy system
transitions, with a particular focus on integrated assessment platforms. We will weave together perspectives
on energy systems transitions and modeling from the engineering, economics, policy, and historical
perspectives. We will begin with a historical perspective on energy systems transitions, from biomass to coal,
oil, natural gas and electricity which will then serve as context to our current decarbonization transition. We
will then explore how the modelling landscape has evolved through these transitions, before delving into
integrated assessment modelling specifically. This course strives to foster a holistic perspective, including the
overarching paradigm shifts in energy system modelling, marginal versus fundamental shifts, and systems
integration. Interspersed through these content-driven discussions, students will practice the application of
relevant principles in interdisciplinary integrated assessment modelling in a lab setting. For students engaged in
energy-climate work across campus, the integrated assessment modelling focus adopted in this course will
serve as a frame through which we can consider broader implications. By understanding how systems interact,
both theoretically, in terms of resource flows, from institutional and historical frames, we can better design and
manage our energy, water, and land systems. The primary purpose of this course is to instill an appreciation of
the highly interconnected nature of our energy-climate problem and the transition before us.


Learning Outcomes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At the end of this course, students are able to:

- Describe the current and historical paradigms governing energy system transitions;
- Explain role of modelling in the energy systems transition discourse;
- Develop and apply basic python programming skills including manipulating data inputs and creating effective visualizations;
- Describe the interactions between sub-systems through an integrated assessment lens;
- Apply your understanding of the current modelling landscape to articulate upcoming modelling needs;
- Evaluate global climate policies from a systems perspective;
- Synthesize and communicate decarbonization pathways using an integrated assessment model.

| Reading Discussion Lead (individual) | 30%    | During each discussion based class (alternating weeks, see schedule below) one student (the 'discussion lead') will |
| 1-page summary                      |        | lead the class through a discussion, while the remaining students will contribute to the discussion. Refer to the    |
|                                     |        | instructions below. The schedule for the discussion lead will be determined in Class 1. Refer to the grading         |
|                                     |        | rubrics for each (leading and contributing). You must provide a valid reason and evidence for missed classes.         |

| Term project: integrated assessment  | 45%    | An 8-page conference style paper describing the integrated assessment model, the context for their research question, |
| model application                   |        | and the output of their model application (scenario). To be submitted prior to your presentation.                     |
