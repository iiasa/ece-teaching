This course is part of the Master's degree program in `Environmental Technology & International Affairs`_ 
held at the Technical University Vienna (TU Wien).
The course is designed and delivered by `Dr. Behnam Zakeri <https://www.iiasa.ac.at/staff/zakeri>`_,
including several lectures by guest speakers/lecturers.

Scope
^^^^^

The course offers a general overview on drivers of and barriers to global energy transitions.
Governing principles of international energy markets are reviewed briefly, with a view on the geopolitics of energy transitions.
The role of technological innovations, socio-behavioral dimensions, and economic/political perspectives are discussed.
Some contemporary topics in global energy transitions, such as, energy access and poverty,
and energy and digitalization are reviewed. The role of modeling and scenario development in energy and climate policy design is another topic of the course. 
International environmental and climate agreements are reviewed, with a view on successful examples and lessons learned.
The course is multi-disciplinary, suitable for students with different backgrounds, including but not limited to engineering, science, economics, and politics.
