GAINS Workshops
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The aim of the workshop is to help new users of the GAINS
modelling framework getting started with their modelling work.
The main features of the “framework” are introduced, and the
use cases of some features are shown. The user can learn how
to build their own emission scenarios, adjust and create new policy
constraints and run analysis on costs and co-benefits.
For information about the model, its structure, mathematical
formulation and much more, please see the `documentation <http://gains.iiasa.ac.at/models/gains_resources.html>`_.
