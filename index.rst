Teaching and learning material by the Energy, Climate, and Environment Program (ECE)
====================================================================================

The IIASA Energy, Climate, and Environment (ECE) Program and its staff
are involved in many activities to support learning about model-based
E/C/E research, especially using software and tools such as the MESSAGEix
framework that we use ourselves.
This page outlines and links to some of these activities & opportunities,
and also the teaching & learning materials and resources used in those activities.

Learning can take place in many ways, from self-directed study by individuals
to for-credit courses at degree-granting institutions taught by a
knowledgeable instructor. The right materials and venue for learning
depends on factors including your current level of knowledge, learning goals,
and time and resources you have available.
The aim of this page is to clearly describe all the activities and
materials so you can make an appropriate choice for your needs.

Workshops and tutorials organised by ECE
----------------------------------------

Our recorded workshops and tutorials are particularly suitable for
dealing intensively with a topic in a defined time frame. The synergy
of lecture and practice gives you the chance to apply what you have
learned directly - and of course to rewind as often as you like and need.
