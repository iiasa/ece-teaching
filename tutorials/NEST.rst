The NExus Solutions Tool
========================

The NExus Solutions Tool (NEST) is an open modeling platform that integrates multi-scale energy–water–land resource optimization with distributed hydrological modeling. The approach provides insights into the vulnerability  of  water,  energy  and  land  resources  to  future socioeconomic and climatic change and how multi-sectoral policies,  technological  solutions  and  investments  can  improve the resilience and sustainability of transformation pathways while avoiding counterproductive interactions among sectors. NEST can be applied at different spatial and temporal  resolutions,  and  is  designed  specifically  to  tap  into the  growing  body  of  open-access  geospatial  data  available through national inventories and the Earth system modeling community. A case study analysis of the Indus River basin in  South  Asia  demonstrates  the  capability  of  the  model  to capture important interlinkages across system transformation pathways towards the United Nations’ Sustainable Development  Goals,  including  the  intersections  between  local  and regional transboundary policies and incremental investment costs from rapidly increasing regional consumption projected over the coming decades. The documentation and code for the initial case studies is published by Vinca et al., 2020, and can be found online.

A newer version of NEST has been developed, and also referred to as the "MESSAGEix-Nexus" module. This uses the MESSAGEix framework ( see :ref:`MESSAGEix Workshop <messageix workshop>` ) developed at IIASA and allows the generation of country models with representation of the Energy-water-land system similar to the previously developed NEST model in Vinca et al., 2020.
Most of the development is currently under submission and not yet public.

The following presentation introduces the first version of NEST and the MESSAGEix-Nexus module:

- NEST and MESSAGEix-Nexus module. September 2022, IAMs workshop at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS)
  and October 2022 Engage Stakeholder workshop (`link to the PURE IIASA database <https://pure.iiasa.ac.at/18513>`_)
